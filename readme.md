###  FullStack Engineer


Full-stack developer with more than 5 years of experience creating attractive, efficient and scalable web and mobile applications. My experience in different languages and technologies allows me to easily adapt to the challenges and needs of each project.

With a strong foundation in the language, I have worked on projects ranging from single page applications (SPAs) to large enterprise applications. My experience includes designing and implementing innovative solutions to improve user interaction and optimize application performance.

I have developed projects using React since its first versions, adapting to its changes and improvements over time. My experience with React includes creating reusable components, efficient state handling, and integrating with third-party libraries to improve the user experience.

My Node.js experience ranges from developing RESTful APIs to building real-time applications with Socket.IO. I have worked on projects that use microservices, which has allowed me to understand and apply the principles of scalability and resilience in my developments.

TypeScript has allowed me to apply object-oriented programming techniques and design principles to my projects, improving the readability and maintainability of the code. In addition, I have used TypeScript to improve development quality and efficiency in JavaScript-based projects.

I have extensive knowledge in HTML5 and CSS3, which allows me to create attractive, accessible and responsive designs for different devices and browsers. I have worked with frameworks like Bootstrap and Material-UI, as well as design methodologies like BEM and Atomic Design.

I am a developer committed to excellence and quality in every project I undertake. My proactive approach and ability to work in a team make me an ideal candidate for any company looking for an expert in web and mobile technologies. I am eager to bring my skills and experience to new challenges and projects.
